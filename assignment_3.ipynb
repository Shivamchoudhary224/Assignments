        "\n",
        "for eg: Take a sample distibution of weight of 100 people and to find the area under the curve between two limits supposed to be a and b we have to fine the intergral of the it.\n",

        "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Cdf is used to describe the probability distribution of both discrete and continous random variables. The CDF gives us the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to x, in other words we can say that it is the analysis of the frequency of occurrence of values of a phenomenon less than a reference value.\n",
        "For example:You have two fair six-sided dice and the cumulative probability of getting a sum less than or equal to a certain value.\n",

        "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "ans: Height of Individuals, Iq of individuals, financial analysis, market risk etc are few of the situation where normal distribution can be used as a model.\n",
        "Normal distribution follows a bell curve like distribution which has equal ammount of data values present on both the sides of it i.e 50 percent data is present on the right side of the distribution and 50 percent data is present on the left side of distribution, in a normally distributed data 68 percent data falls within the first standard deviation and 95 percent data falls within the second standard distribution and similarlly 97 percent data falls within the 3rd standard deviation from mean.\n",

        "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "ans: Normal distribution had various important factors related to it like universal acceptability, central limit theory, statstical infrences that we can draw from it.\n",
        "Real life examples are: height distribution over population, affect of medicine on weight, affect of change in mrp over sales etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "ans: Bernaulli distribution explain the propability of an event where there are only two possible outcomes for a single and sum of all the events results to 1, in bernaulli distribution we denote success of an event by p and failure to achieve success by q = p-1.\n",
        "Major difference between bernaulli and bionomial distribution is that bionominal distribution has multiple instances of occurance of an event where as bernaulli has only single event with two outcomes.\n",

        "Q6:To find the probability that a randomly selected observation from a normally distributed dataset with a mean (μ) of 50 and a standard deviation (σ) of 10 will be greater than 60, you can use the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) and the z-score formula.\n",

        "Ans: Uniform distribution explains the probability distribution of random discrete variables where each even has a same porbability outcome. Eg throwing a dice n times\n",

        "Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: z-score, also known as the standard score, is a statistical measure that quantifies how far a particular data point is from the mean of a dataset in terms of standard deviations. It allows to standardize and compare data points from different datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Z score allows us to perform hypothesis testing, standardizing the distributions and identifying outliers.\n",
