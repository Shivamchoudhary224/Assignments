        "\n",
        "Ans. Statistics is a branch of science which deals with collection, organization and visualization of data to derive usefull insights from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Statistics has two types:\n",
        "1. Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics is used to organize and summarize data. Eg. Mean, median, mode is frequently used to summarize a data, for instance consider population of sample for height of 100 people, here descriptive statistics will helps us to identify the mean where maximum data points are concentrated.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Inferential Stastistics: Inferential stastics is used to draw infrence for population using sample data. Eg. z-test, t-test are used to draw the infrences for population using sample data.\n",
        "For instance considering the example of a sample which has data for the height of people now using the sample data we can estimate the parameters for population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of\n",
        "each type of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Data is of two types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Qualitative Data: It has categorial data. For eg: Gender of people in an office it can be male, female, LGBTQ.\n",
        "\n",
        "It further has 2 types:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Nominal data: It is a type of data in which rank does not matter,Example: Size of clothes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Ordinal data: It is a type of data in which rank plays an important role. Example: Rating given to a resturant.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Quantative Data: It has only numerical data. Eg: Height of 100 people.\n",
        "\n",
        "It further has 2 types:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Discrete data: It has data whose values are always whole numbers. Eg: number of children.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Continous Data: It has data whose values can take any numerical value. Eg: weight.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:\n",
        "(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E\n",
        "(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red\n",
        "(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...]\n",
        "(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...]\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: (i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E : Qualitative ordinal data.\n",
        "(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red : Qualitative nominal data.\n",
        "(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...] : Quantative Continous data.\n",

        "Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Levels of measurment:\n",
        "1. Nominal Scale data: In this data can only be categorize.\n",
        "Example: gender related data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ordinal Scale data: Here data can be categorize and ranked. Example Rating given at a resturant.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Interval scale data: Here data can be categorize, rank and also can be infered into intervals but cannot has 0 as its starting point. Example: Test score\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Ratio Scale data: Here data can be categorize, rank and also can be infered into intervals but can has 0 as its starting point. Example: height\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an\n",
        "example to illustrate your answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Different level of measurements restricts the techniques of descriptive and inferential stats that we can use on data to summarize data.\n",
        "\n",
        "for example: salary data can be both ordinal if we create brackets and assign a code to each bracket where as is also an type of ratio data which starts from 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. In nominal data we only categorize the data where as in ordinal type of data each category has an order which they follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Histograms\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each\n",
        "type of statistics and explain how they are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics is used to organize and summarize data. Eg.

        "Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain\n",
        "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. For central tendancy, we have mean, median and mode. Mean is the sum of all values divided by total number of data points but mean is more vulnerable to outliers thats why we use median which is insenstive to outliers as it is the mid point of the distribution, where as mode is used when we have categorical data, it the most frequently occuring element.\n",
        "\n",
        "for Variability we have variance and standard deviations, variance explains the spread of data where as standard deviation explains how far each data value is from mean."
